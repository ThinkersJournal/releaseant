# Changelog

## 0.0.8

- External prerequisites: `externals::missing_externals`, `Registry::versions`, `Index::versions`; `publish` refuses (before writing anything) when a dependency outside the set is not satisfiable on the registry; `plan --check-externals`.

## 0.0.7

- R4 preparation: `docs/REHEARSAL.md` and `docs/rehearsal/rehearse.sh` (the real-registry rehearsal on three placeholder crates, run by the PM with the token; the lane never sees it). Names verified free.

## 0.0.6

- R3b: `releaseant` CLI (`plan`, `verify`, `publish` (alias `resume`), `readback`, `yank`; dry-run unless `--execute`), real crates.io registry (sparse-index lookups, `cargo publish` adapter with SHA-256 of the uploaded `.crate`, server-advised rate-limit waits), `pipeline` (archive, package as a set, verify, run, consumer checks for recorded verification exceptions), `yank` with recorded reasons. `Cargo::package_set`. New `EventKind::Yanked`.

## 0.0.5

- R3a process layer: `source` (commit archive, independent of line-ending config), `cargo` (run cargo, package), `classify` (cargo output against captured samples; unknown stays unknown), `verify` (build the extracted tarballs). Captured cargo output in `tests/fixtures/`. Real-cargo test of the dev/optional dependency table.

## 0.0.4

- R2 core library: metadata parsing, publish plan (edge rule, cycle error, prerelease check, deterministic order), append-only ledger, run loop with resume, rate-limit waits, read-back and checksum comparison, over `Registry`/`Clock` traits with a scriptable fake. Decisions on the DESIGN review items recorded in `docs/DESIGN.md` section 10.

## 0.0.3

- R1 design: `docs/DESIGN.md` (publish-set rule measured with real `cargo package`, cycle = error, failure classification, ledger and resume, read-back, yank policy, test plan with a negative control per trap).

## 0.0.2

- R0 survey: `docs/SURVEY.md` lists what the hand-written publish tooling does, what it shares, and what none of it does.
- LICENSE-MIT holder is now "The releaseant contributors" (PM, quoting CireSnave 2026-10-24 on decision 263: "Go with your recommendations").

## 0.0.1

- Repository seeded by the PM: CI, deny policy, licences, roadmap and first handoff. No code yet.
