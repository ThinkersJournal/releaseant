# Changelog

## 0.0.4

- R2 core library: metadata parsing, publish plan (edge rule, cycle error, prerelease check, deterministic order), append-only ledger, run loop with resume, rate-limit waits, read-back and checksum comparison, over `Registry`/`Clock` traits with a scriptable fake. Decisions on the DESIGN review items recorded in `docs/DESIGN.md` section 10.

## 0.0.3

- R1 design: `docs/DESIGN.md` (publish-set rule measured with real `cargo package`, cycle = error, failure classification, ledger and resume, read-back, yank policy, test plan with a negative control per trap).

## 0.0.2

- R0 survey: `docs/SURVEY.md` lists what the hand-written publish tooling does, what it shares, and what none of it does.
- LICENSE-MIT holder is now "The releaseant contributors" (PM, quoting CireSnave 2026-10-24 on decision 263: "Go with your recommendations").

## 0.0.1

- Repository seeded by the PM: CI, deny policy, licences, roadmap and first handoff. No code yet.
